## Journal Review, Word Usage 

Objective
: The paper covers the tendencies of communication that surround complex networks or communities.
The goal of the paper was to assess if there are unique language traits found within 
communities, and if they could predict the communities for each user.  

Hypothesis
: The authors hypothesise that communities communicate with similar word usage through social networks. 

Methods
: The hypothesis was tested using data from Twitter. The authors constructed their networks by compiling 
users into groups that interacted with one another. Once groups were established, the groups were 
then tested for word frequencies specifically used by those users. They tested their groupings with
maximum modularity and found their groupings to be far greater than a random network. They also tested 
their groupings using the map equation and still found the groupings to be sufficient. After the 
network tests, the study tried to find the top 100 words utilized by these groupings. Using the word usage
and the networks the authors used Euclidean distance to test their pairings (I'm assuming this is 
similar to KNN). Their methodology worked well as the study was able to group a user, using 1000 of 
their words, to correctly group them 72% accuracy.  

Conclusions
: I found this paper to be entertaining and well organized. While not familar with the statistical 
algorithms, I was able to follow the basic procedures. I appreciated the layout of the paper and how
they included the methodologies with the corresponding equations used for their study. The study was 
intriguing because I want to know how the differences between Map Equation and Maximum Modularity, and 
I appreciate the authors' willingness to show both results. Last, within the social networking
world, is classifying a user at 73% a substantial rate of success?
