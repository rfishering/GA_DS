 ## I know this doesn't apply as well as the other models we have covered in class. 
 ## But this was the only code I wrote, where I got the outcome I was half expecting 
 ## the code would spit out. I promise i put in more than 8 hours in trying to code
 ## and I feel i've turned a corner this week with Github and coding in general.
